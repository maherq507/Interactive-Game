# Interactive-Game
An Interactive Cyclone Game Built for the Arduino 

Game Description: 
One random LED will light up and become the target with a player dot cycling through the entire LEDâ€™s. The user can try to press down either button when the playerdot overlaps the target LED to try and win. Each time the player sucessfully does this the lights will flash green, make a happy noise, and advance the user to the next level. If the user doesn't stop the light on the target, the lights will flash red, make a bad noise, and then keep the game going. If the user makes it through all 10 levels they will be rewarded with a special light pattern and be able to restart the game.

Left button: Used to stop the circling LED
Right button: Used to stop the circling LED


Outputs:
LED lights: To show the game targets and circling LED lights
Speakers: To show if a target was missed with a sound
Serial Monitor: To show the user his current level
